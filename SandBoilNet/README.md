# Paper Title: Deep Learning Approach for Accurate Segmentation of Sand Boils in Levee Systems
This repository contains codebase and links for datasets of our paper based on controlled transfer learning. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You would need to install the following software before replicating this framework in your local or server machine.

```
Python version 3.7+
Aanaconda version 3+
TensorFlow version 2.12.0
Keras version 2.12.0

```

## Download and install code
- Retrieve the code
```
git clone https://github.com/manisa/SandBoilNet.git
cd SandBoilNet
```

- Create and activate the virtual environment with python dependendencies. 
```
conda create -n gpu-tf tensorflow-gpu
conda activate gpu-tf
pip install tensorflow==2.12.*

```



## Download datasets
